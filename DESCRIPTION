Description: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation to fit a zero-inflated poisson Bayesian network models for zero-inflated count data such as scRNA-seq data. Each local distribution of a Bayesian network is assumed to be a zero-inflated poisson regression model. The algorithm uses Metropolis-Within-Gibbs sampling for posterior inference.
